# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Please make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

In your preferred file directory clone the repository with ("git clone https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app")

Open the folder and in the command line run ("npm install")

After the process is completed make sure to run it using npm start.

You can also make a build file using ("npm run build") and then start the build file with ("serve -s build")

This project is following standard rules of prettify, ESLint, AIrBNB rules. If the settings.json don't work please copy it and paste it in your Code Editor's package.json file

A custom Counter hook named useCounter was created and test cases for the counter were written.

If you want to test it just run ("npm test")

Now for the App, user will first get the SignUp page where he will have to use the required data and submit. Currently all the field are required. Any missing information will be validated and after successful registration a link will appear at the end. User can then see the users list table
